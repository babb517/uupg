=====================================================
	
The Universally Unique Password Generator (UUPG) allows you to use a 
single password for virtually every website securely. It uses the password 
you input (which is never sent to any other computer or stored) along with 
some string unique to ever website (such as its name) to generate a unique 
password for every website which can then be copied and pasted to the 
website's password prompt. 

As the UUPG doesn't rely on saving your passwords and instead generates 
them on-the-go it is more secure and more mobile than other solutions, such 
as a password keychain. Additionally, the program is implemented using HTML 
and Javascript, so it can be run on any modern web browser regardless of 
operating systems (even your phones) and accessed over the internet as a 
website.

Currently the UUPG is hosted at http(s)://origin.dyndns-server.com/uupg/uupg.html. 
As previously mentioned, your password _never_ leaves your computer 
(all calculations are done client side). The UUPG is open source and 
available  under the GNU GPL (see src/COPYING for details). I encourage you 
to keep an offline copy of the UUPG with you in case you are unable to
access the online version for any reason.

Unfortunatly website's have grown accustomed to providing a strict password 
policy which is often required in order to prevent users from selecting passwords 
that are too weak or because the website is not using the industry standard 
security techniques and instead are simply storing passwords in an unsecure 
location. Due to this, it is neccessary to ensure that the generated password 
conforms to each of the website's policies. The current version of the UUPG 
utilizes an XML file in order to specify these for various website's password 
policies to ease the burden of remembering each of them. This is in the 
policies.xml file provided with the source code. The online version uses a
similar XML which has been pre-populated with a number of common websites.
